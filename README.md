Functional Design and Requirement Spec for Draw It or Lose It, The Gaming Room

The Gaming Room asked for a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, expanding it from Android to work on different operating systems such as, Windows, macOS, and Linux. The game lets teams guess stock images within timed rounds, so the new version needed to handle real-time syncing, scalability, and secure data. I designed a solution using Linux for the server (for stability and scalability), WebSockets for real-time communication, and responsive web design so that the game works smoothly across devices. Cloud storage handles the images, and a relational database manages game data like users, teams, and scores.

Writing the design document helped me map out these decisions clearly before any coding was considered. I made sure to tie everything back to what the client needed: consistent gameplay, cross-platform access, and room to grow. If I could improve one thing, I’d add more details about performance targets like latency and user load. Understanding the client’s needs guided every choice in the document—from picking tools that scale to making sure the game stays responsive. For future projects, I would reuse this approach of breaking down requirements early, map out system designs with diagrams, and get feedback sooner to stay on track.
